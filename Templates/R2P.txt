Subject: URGENT: Demand for Immediate Intervention & Diplomatic Action in Iran

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you with the utmost urgency to demand immediate and decisive intervention to stop the systematic slaughter of civilians in Iran. As of January 21, 2026, the Islamic Republic has escalated its crackdown to a level of mass atrocity, with casualties estimated at over 20,000 dead and 300,000 injured.

The Iranian people are being systematically targeted under a total communications blackout. My compatriots have compiled a repository documenting CLEAR and undeniable signs of human rights violations including security forces opening fire on peaceful crowds, extrajudicial execution of protesters, and many more.

Please note that this repository is a collection of photos and videos that show only a fraction of the atrocities occurring in Iran right now. Due to the internet shutdown and electricity cuts, many more crimes remain undocumented, hidden from the world’s view.

The Iranian people are no longer just asking for "solidarity" or "condemnation." In the face of certain death, they are explicitly calling for international protection and military intervention to dismantle the regime’s killing machine. Under the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, the international community is legally and morally bound to act when a state is committing crimes against humanity on this scale.

I demand that you and your government take the following actions immediately:

-   Support Military-Backed Protection: Advocate for the use of "all necessary means" under R2P to stop the massacre.
    
-   Complete Diplomatic Severance: Immediately close all Islamic Republic embassies, expel their diplomats, and recall your ambassadors from Tehran.
    
-   Financial Paralysis: Freeze all assets of the Islamic Republic and its officials. These funds must be seized and held for the future benefit of the Iranian people.
    
-   Recognize the Opposition Leadership: Formally invite and recognize Reza Pahlavi as the representative of the Iranian opposition to speak before the EU Parliament/National Legislature and coordinate the transition toward a secular, democratic Iran.
    
-   Direct Aid to Protesters: Take active measures to provide satellite internet technology and the material support necessary for the people to defend themselves against the regime’s state-sponsored terrorism.
    

The time for cautious diplomacy has passed. The Iranian people are paying for their freedom with their blood, and they are looking to global leaders to match their courage with action.

I expect a prompt response detailing what steps you are taking to meet these demands.

Sincerely,

[Full Name] , Resident of [City] [Email Address]
