# Contacting European Representatives – Iran

This repository is intended to help members of the Iranian diaspora and other concerned individuals easily contact elected representatives in Europe regarding the situation in Iran.

It provides:
- **Public email addresses** of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), organized by country.
- **Ready-to-use email templates** that can be adapted and sent directly to representatives.

The goal is to lower the barrier for civic engagement and enable coordinated, lawful, and respectful communication with policymakers.

## Repository Structure

- `MEPs/`  
  Contains text files with email addresses of MEPs, grouped by ISO country codes. See the [Country Reference Table](#country-reference-table) below for mapping.
  - `ALL.txt` contains a combined list of all representatives.
  
- `Templates/`  
  Contains sample email templates that users can copy, customize, and send. Templates are written to be factual, concise, and suitable for correspondence with elected officials.
