# Contacting European Representatives – Iran

This repository is intended to help members of the Iranian diaspora and other concerned individuals easily contact elected representatives in Europe regarding the situation in Iran.

It provides:
- Public email addresses of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), organized by country
- Ready-to-use email templates that can be adapted and sent directly to representatives

The goal is to lower the barrier for civic engagement and enable coordinated, lawful, and respectful communication with policymakers.

## Repository structure

- `MEPs/`  
  Contains text files with email addresses of Members of the European Parliament, grouped by country code (e.g. `DE.txt`, `FR.txt`, `SE.txt`).  
  `ALL.txt` contains a combined list.

- `Templates/`  
  Contains sample email templates that users can copy, customize, and send.  
  Templates are written to be factual, concise, and suitable for correspondence with elected officials.

## How to use

1. Navigate to the `MEPs/` folder
2. Open the file corresponding to your country (or `ALL.txt`)
3. Copy one or more email addresses
4. Open a template from the `Templates/` folder
5. Customize the text as you see fit
6. Send the email from your own email account

## Notes

- All email addresses included are publicly available official contact details.

- Communications should remain respectful and lawful.
- This repository does not send emails automatically and does not collect any user data.
